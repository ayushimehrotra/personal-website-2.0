# Introduction

Adversarial examples have been a persistent challenge in deep learning security...

## Mathematical Framework

Let's define adversarial robustness formally. Given a classifier $f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ and an input $x \in \mathcal{X}$, we say that $f$ is $\epsilon$-robust at $x$ if:

$$\forall \delta \in \mathcal{B}_p(0, \epsilon): f(x + \delta) = f(x)$$

where $\mathcal{B}_p(0, \epsilon)$ is the $\ell_p$ ball of radius $\epsilon$ centered at the origin.

## Key Insights

The figure above shows how small perturbations can fool a neural network...

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def fgsm_attack(model, x, y, epsilon):
    """Fast Gradient Sign Method attack"""
    x.requires_grad_()
    loss = F.cross_entropy(model(x), y)
    loss.backward()
    return x + epsilon * x.grad.sign()
```

## Conclusion

Through the lens of mechanistic interpretability, we can begin to understand...
